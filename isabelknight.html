	<p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
		I am an Instructional Designer living and working in Washington DC. 

		I graduated from Swarthmore College with High Honors in Political Science.

		I love to learn and am constantly trying to find ways to push myself further. For example, this is the first website I have coded from scratch!

		I speak Spanish fluently and am conversational in Chinese. 

		I really enjoy Ultimate Frisbee, playing trombone, and thinking about the various ways to design institutions with better incentive structures. Read on to see examples of my work and writing!

    <h5>Passport to Success for Hospitality Chinese Translation</h5>
    <p class="card-text">I adapted these 5 modules for Chinese audiences, with all text and narration translated into Mandarin Chinese. This required coordinating with Chinese voice actors and syncing their newly recorded audio to the speech bubbles in the course.

    <p class="card-text">I created storyboards for a 14-hour set of courses on Open Data for the World Bank to serve as an introductory primer on how leaders around the world can use open data in their businesses. The first course focuses on how managers can promote the use of open data in their businesses, including how to contribute to and benefit from communities of open data users and practitioners. The second course shows data producers how to ensure the data they produce is truly open and accessible to all, including making sure the data they release is properly licensed, well-documented, standardized, anonymized, and machine-readable. The third course shows users how they can find and use open data, make Freedom of Information Act requests for government data, and how they can provide meaningful feedback to data producers to help maintain public datasets.</p>
